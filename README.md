# Palette Picker

* A combination of [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material UI Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/?utm_source=launchers) tools.
* This site allows users to create and save color palettes for use in web development.
* I completed this project as part of The Modern React Bootcamp by Colt Steele, and added my own touches to it.
